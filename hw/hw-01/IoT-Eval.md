Item 1: Stoplight
A stoplight is an example of an embedded system. The lights at an intersection are able to compute so that they know when to turn green, yellow, or red. They sense the area around them whether it be a button pushed to allow a pedestrian to cross, or a sensor reads a car has arrived so that it should change. These sensors data is stored and then used to execute code to control the real world output of the lights.
Traffic lights are not and should not work on the internet. While connection to the internet could allow for information on the lights in the city it would also be extremely expensive to convert all lights to internet connection. By not being connected to the internet, lights are less vulnerable to attacks that could leave the city without lights. Adding internet to traffic lights would increase costs and risk so it should not be done.

Item 2: Refrigerator
A fridge is also an example of an embedded system. It senses the opening of the door, usually with a switch. It also regulates its temperature by using another sensor. This information must be stored and then is used for computations to decide if an action should be performed like turing the light on/off or lowering the temperature. These control something in the real world like the light or motor to generate more cold air.
The fridge in our room is not connected to the internet. Connecting to the internet would allow for more control over the fridge from a distance. The temperature could be monitored and changed. If a camera was added it could be used to figure out what is needed at the store. Connection to the internet is not needed but could add some benefit to a refrigerator.
