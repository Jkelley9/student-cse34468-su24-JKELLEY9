The device connects to the internet and allows for control over all aspects of the device while making the coffee. While making your perfect coffee you can change each step to slowly craft your favorite type. The device is a good concept. It takes peoples desire to have high quality coffee in their own home. While I would never spend 2000 dollars on an expresso machine, it is very clear there is a market of people that would. These people already have expensive machines and the ability to control all aspects of their coffee is very enticing.
